        The name India is derived from Indus
        which originates from the Old Persian word Hindush
        equivalent to the Sanskrit word Sindhu
        which was the historical local appellation for the Indus River
        The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi
        which translates as The people of the Indus[22]

        The geographical term Bharat (BhƒÅrat; pronounced,
        which is recognised by the Constitution of India as an official name for the country,
        is used by many Indian languages in its variations
        It is a modernisation of the historical name Bharatavarsha,
        which traditionally referred to the Indian subcontinent and
        gained increasing currency from the mid-19th century as a
        native name for India
        Hindustan (] (listen)) is a Middle Persian name for India
        It was introduced into India by the Mughals and widely used since then
        Its meaning varied, referring to a region that encompassed northern India
        and Pakistan or India in its entirety[18][24][25] Currently, the name may
        refer to either the northern part of India or the entire country

        Java is a general-purpose programming language
        that is class-based, object-oriented[16](although not a pure OO language[17]),
        and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible
        It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere
        (WORA),[18] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
        support Java without the need for recompilation[19] Java applications are
        typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine
        (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture The syntax of Java
        is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of
        them As of 2018, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use
        according to GitHub,[20] [21] particularly for client-server web applications,
        with a reported 9 million developers[22]
        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
        (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a
        core component of Sun Microsystems Java platform The original and
        reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class
        libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses
        As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process,
        Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License
        Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies,
        such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries),
        and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets)
